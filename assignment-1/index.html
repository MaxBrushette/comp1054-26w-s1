            <p>I wanna live forever is that too much to ask? <br>Enough dry heaving in the mirror and fogging up the glass <br>I wanna like the way I look without an ugly T-shirt <br>
            But I'm afraid that if I like my clothes, I'll hate what's underneath <br>What if I'll never be the person that I swore I'd give my everything to be? <br>Forever dumb and awkward, skinny, lonely <br>Wasting time and drowning in my dreams <br>I missed my lunch already, why not skip dinner too? <br> Caught up on tiger lilies dying, dying int heir bloom <br > You said forever's just a feeling, like all things too will pass, <br> and I'll waste a lifetime, honey, trying to make it last <br> Maybe  I'll never be the person that I swore I'd give my everything to be <br> Forever dumb and awkward, skinny, lonely <br> Wasting time and drowning in my dreams</p>
